Dashboard for a restaurant platform, based on a dataset provided by Zomato Restaurants on the Kaggle website.

The Hunger Zero Restaurants platform gathers data from over 6900 restaurants in 15 registered countries. For each restaurant, users can explore its location, average rating, primary cuisine type, price of a meal for two people (based on the country's currency), among other details. Through filters, users can compare the prices and ratings of restaurants by country/city, by cuisine type, and so on
